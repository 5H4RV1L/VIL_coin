# 🪙 VIL Coin — Decentralized Blockchain Network

VIL Coin is a **Python-based peer-to-peer blockchain simulation** that lets you create accounts, send virtual coins, mine blocks, and synchronize data between network peers — all in real time.  
It includes both a **command-line interface (CLI)** and a **modern GUI** built with `tkinter`.
